# FiveRP
An alternative to bloated roleplay frameworks for FiveM.
# Information
The framework is a basic, understandable, and bloat-free solution for roleplay frameworks on FiveM. 

Most popular RP frameworks have unnecessary functions (like notifications, which are native in FiveM), but this framework is completely modular. 

## Whats a Modular? ##

Do you want to have a prebuilt notification method / function? Create / Place a notification resource for FiveRP into the resource folder!

This framework does not have an expected release day, but do expect this to be either complete or in beta by Spring 2019.
