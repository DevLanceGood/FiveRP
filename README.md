# FiveRP

An alternative to bloated roleplay frameworks for FiveM.

# Information

The framework is a basic, understandable, and bloat-free solution for roleplay gamemodes on FiveM. 

Most popular RP gamemodes have unnecessary functions (like notifications, which are native in FiveM), but this gamemode is completely modular. 

This framework does not have an expected release day, but do expect this to be either complete by Spring 2019.

## What are Modules? ##

Do you want to have a prebuilt notification method / function? Create / Place a notification resource for FiveRP into the resource folder!

## What should I use with this? ##

If you want to use this gamemode in it's current state, a Server-Sided menu is advised. Everything that is inside there works, however there isn't any usage for jobs yet.

## Documentation ##

This will be filled out ASAP!
